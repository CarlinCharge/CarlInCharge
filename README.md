### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Carl is my name and I'm a developer who started as the kid who always hogged the family computer into a tech nerd and gearhead.

My main focus has been on frontend development. Technology continues to move at a fast pace and because of that I highly value continually being educated and open to learning.
## Languages and Tooling

### Ruby and Pure JS and React beginnings
I started my programming journey by learning Ruby to get familar with coding. An easy to read, object oriented language allowed me to focus more on the important basics. From there, I expanded into writing web apps and was lucky enough to be early in the React ecosystem.

### React.js
When I was just getting started with React, I built a [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/CarlinCharge/react-boilerplate). I also have experience with using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Many of these tools have become used widely in the development world and I appreciate that they do so much to assist a lot of the more technical parts of development so I can devote more energy to creative problem solving.

### Tools I use
* My editor of choice is **VSCode**
* For code formatting/syntax I enjoy using **Prettier** and **EsLint**
* Occassionally I use **Docker** for spinning up environments
* I've used PostgresQL, MySQL as well as Firebase, MongoDB + MongoDB Atlas and GraphQL as database tools

### Continuing To Learn
I've had a subscription to [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com) for years and more recently have enrolled in some [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses) courses in order to stay sharp. Additionally I've slowly been working through [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). You might be able to tell, I am a big believer in online learning. It's an important skill in development and life in general.

### Outside Coding
Who am I really? Well, I guess a nerd and creative type. I have my own small business [Carl Conroy Design](https://www.carlconroydesign.com/). I make films and photograph weddings and all kinds of occassions. I love playing video games and going on adventuers with friends. Software is just another medium through which I can problem solve and express myself creatively.
